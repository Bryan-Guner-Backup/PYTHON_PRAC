Binary Search Tree
==================

**Binary search trees** are binary trees that keep their nodes in sorted order, so that lookup and other operations can use *binary search*.

Constraints
-----------

-   A child has only *one* parent and the root node has *no* parent.
-   Each node can have a max of 2 children.
-   Each node’s *left* subtree is **less than** its parent’s value.
-   Each node’s *right* subtree is **greater than** its parent’s value.
